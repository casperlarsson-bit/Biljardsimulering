An interactive simulation of a game of billiard using three.js and WebGL.

#### Folder structure

- /src: The source code
- /textures: Texture files as .png or .jpg
- /assets: Blender imports as .glTF files

#### Setup instructions

To be able to run three.js files they have to be stored on a server.
Make sure they are on a local or other server and access the files through the server, 
do *not* open them directly in the folders, since they will not load properly then
